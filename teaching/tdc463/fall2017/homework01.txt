Submit to D2L <http://d2l.depaul.edu>.

Plain text (.txt) is vastly preferred over Microsoft Word documents,
PDF, RTF or other formats.  I should be able to deal with most anything
that is in common use.

Homework:

Q1. Find the IETF RFC entitled "Choosing a Name for Your Computer".
    Fill in the following fields based on information from the RFC:

      * public URL to the RFC:
      * publication month and year:
      * RFC number:
      * Working Group:
      * Category:

      Read it.  Now consider the following two fully qualified domain
      names:

        rtr-710-2w-int-xe-0-0-2.netequip.depaul.edu.
        tata.ord03.atlas.cogentco.com.

      Each of those names is associated with hosts (or more precisely
      interface attachments) using IP addresses 140.192.9.126 and
      154.54.10.162 respectively.  Respond to the following questions:

      * What, if anything, can you infer from the domain names alone?
      * How might these names violate or adhere to the recommendations
        in the RFC above?
      * Do you feel the RFC is fine as is or should it be updated?  If
        it should be updated, what do think is missing or incorrect?



Q2. What are the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for aharp.iorc.depaul.edu?  How
    did you derive this information?



Q3. Imagine you have a trinary (3 digit) numbering system where the
    decimal digit on the left is equivalent to the associated symbol
    on the right.

      0  ----->  *
      1  ----->  A
      2  ----->  9

    In this new trinary numbering system how would you represent the
    decimal value of 62?



Q4. Below is the raw output of the versatile tcpdump utility to display
    a packet captured on a network.  There are three columns and XXX lines
    of output.  The middle column (hexadecimal payload) is the raw packet
    decoded in hexadecimal characters.  The first column (num) denotes the
    "byte" number of the first pair of hex characters at the beginning of
    the middle column.  The third column (decode) is a decode of the middle
    column bytes.  Only printable ASCII characters are decoded, others are
    denoted with a dot.

      - num -  --------- hexadecimal payload ---------  ---- decode ----

      0x0000:  46c0 0020 92d6 0000 0102 49fe 8cc0 da81  F.........I.....
      0x0010:  e000 0001 9404 0000 1164 ee9b 0000 0000  .........d......
      0x0020:  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000       .............. 


      The raw output above is for an IPv4 datagram whose format is described
      in IETF RFC 791 section 3.1.  Using that knowledge, what is the IPv4
      destination address in dotted decimal notation (e.g. 192.0.2.1) of
      the raw packet above?



Q5.  Consider the size of the IPv4 address space.  That is, the total number
     of IP addresses (an integer value).  Note, this is just a maximum
     theoretical value.  Some IP addresses are not assigned or used in
     practice (e.g.  255.254.254.254).  We only care about the theoretical
     value.  What is this theoretical integer number?


     Now consider the total population of the United States.  You may need
     to find a reasonable reference, such as the CIA World Factbook to get an
     approximate value.  If you could assign one IPv4 address to each person
     in the US, approximately how many available IPv4 addresses would remain?
