Plain text (.txt) is vastly preferred over Microsoft Word documents,
PDF, RTF or other formats.  I should be able to deal with most anything
that is in common use.

Homework:

Q1. On a Microsoft, Apple OS X, and Linux system, there is a file
    used by the local operating system and TCP/IP protocol stack
    to associate a port number with an application name.  Using
    one of those three operating systems, identify where the the
    full file path is to this file.  Then, identify approximately
    how many uncommented entries are contained within this file.
    Finally, identify a port number and application from this page
    that is not in your services file:

      <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml>


Q2. Assuming no network interference (e.g. firewalls) or unusual TCP/IP
    stack configuration, what should a TCP/IP host do when it receives
    a UDP message on a port where there is no corresponding listening
    UDP service?



Q3. Assuming no network interference (e.g. firewalls) or unusual TCP/IP
    stack configuration, what should a TCP/IP host do when it receives
    a TCP SYN message on a port where there is no corresponding listening
    service?

    ___ a. Respond with a TCP SYN/ACK indicating an error condition

    ____b. Return a TCP RST

    ___ c. Return a ICMP port unreachable message

    ___ d. Silently discard the message



Q4. Many applications have been implemented to operate over both TCP
    and UDP (e.g. DNS).  Can you name another application that operates
    over both?  Can you name one that is known to operate only over TCP?
    How about one that is known to operate only over UDP?



Q5. On your own system (Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, or Linux), from
    the command line, run:

      netstat -an | more

    Research what each line of output involving UDP or TCP means and
    describe what you've found your system is currently doing.  Do no
    more than 10 if you have more than that.
