Submit to D2L <http://d2l.depaul.edu>.

Plain text (.txt) is vastly preferred over Microsoft Word documents,
PDF, RTF or other formats.  I should be able to deal with most anything
that is in common use.

Homework:

Q1.  One of the first widely used packet amplification and reflection
     attacks was commonly known as the "smurf attack".  Neither the
     early Bellovin paper or the more recent Rossow paper mention it.
     What is the smurf attack and why do you suppose it was not
     mentioned in either of the two papers?



Q2.  Visit <https://crt.sh> and put 'aharp.iorc.depaul.edu' without into
     the text book and search.  Examine the results.  What is this thing
     and what is the specific thing you're looking at after entering the
     domain name into the text box?  Hint, OCSP.



Q3.  What is the SSH implementation that comes with Unix (Apple Mac OS X
     and Linux) called?  What is the most currently released version from
     the original development site today?



Q4.  Using pseudo code, Cisco ACL syntax, or something similar firewall
     instructions, write a packet filter rule set that would enforce the
     following traffic flow (note, assume stateless rules only):

       INBOUND: Do not allow access to any well known privilege ports on
                any hosts.  Allow ping, pong, destination unreachable,
                and time-exceeded messages.  Block any IRC traffic.

       OUTBOUND: Do not allow internal systems to run any servers on
                 the well known ports.  Allow ping, pong, destination
                 unreachable and time-exceeded messages.  Block any IRC
                 traffic.

      Discuss any potential weaknesses in your rule set if someone is
      determined to circumvent them your filters.




Q5. What might a DNS 'CH TXT version.bind' query provide you?
