Plain text (.txt) is vastly preferred over Microsoft Word documents,
PDF, RTF or other formats.  I should be able to deal with most anything
that is in common use.

Homework:

Q1. Given the IPv4 address formulation of 203.0.113.57/26, perform the
    following tasks:

    a. Write the address in dotted binary notation and denote those bits
       that constitute the "network" bits and those bits that make up the
       "host bits", perhaps by putting some sort of marker at the division
       point (e.g. a '|' between the two groups of bits is appropriate).


    b. Write the address in dotted hexadecimal notation.


    c. Identify the first (the network) address for the prefix.


    d. Identify the last (directed broadcast) address for the prefix.


    e. Identify precisely how many total addresses are contained within
       this prefix as an exponential number (two raised to a power).


    f. Identify precisely the maximum number of /29-sized networks that
       could be constructed out of this prefix.


    g. Research what is specifically unique about this address in the
       context of Internet IPv4 address assignments.  Describe what you
       discover.



Q2. IPv4 allocates 127.0.0.0/8 to be used for loopback addressing.  IPv6
    allocates ::1/128.  Do some research on the use of a single IPv6 address
    versus a proposal to use a larger IPv6 loopback address block.  Summarize
    what you have found about the loopback allocation size.  Provide
    references as appropriate.  Do you feel a larger block would be useful
    and appropriate to standardize?



Q3. Identity all of the public Internet IP address space assigned to
    DePaul University in slash (aka CIDR) notation.  Indicate how you
    determined this information.



Q4. What is the dotted decimal equivalent IPv4 address for the integer
    value 3221225985?



Q5. What is the standardized discard prefix for IPv6?  Provide a reference
    to where you discovered the answer.
