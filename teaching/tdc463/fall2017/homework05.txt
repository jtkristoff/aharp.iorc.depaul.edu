Submit to D2L <http://d2l.depaul.edu>.

Plain text (.txt) is vastly preferred over Microsoft Word documents,
PDF, RTF or other formats.  I should be able to deal with most anything
that is in common use.

Homework:

Q1.  Review IETF RFC 4271 Section 4.2.  Notice the "My Autonomous
     Field" in the OPEN Message Format.  Now consider the ASN 393232
     (you can use arin.net to perform a look up on it).  What is
     peculiar about this ASN value and the RFC you just examined?
     Will this value work with BGP?  If so, how?  If not, why not?



Q2. You receive the following BGP announcements from three different
    peers.  Which route would you prefer when forwarding a datagram
    to the destination 192.0.2.1?  Assume the default LOCAL-PREF
    value is 100 is not specified and there is no MED value unless
    specified.

   ___ a. 192.0.2.0/24 AS-PATH: 4,3,2,1 MED: 100, LOCAL-PREF: 200

   ___ b. 192.0.2.0/24 AS-PATH: 5,2,1

   ___ c. 192.0.2.0/24 AS-PATH: 7,6,2,1 MED: 200, LOCAL-PREF: 50

   ___ d. 192.0.2.0/23 AS-PATH: 1

   ___ e. 192.0.2.0/25 AS-PATH: 8,9,10,15,255,3829,33

   ___ f. 0.0.0.0/0 AS-PATH: 11 MED: 200, LOCAL-PREF: 300



Q3. Assume the DePaul University network is a heavily guarded network
    and very little malevolent traffic is allowed onto the university
    infrastructure.  How might you conduct an availability
    (denial-of-service) attack against the university?



Q4. What sorts of things might you do to protect against attacks
    enumerated above in Q4?



Q5. Given the following pair of routers that have a point-to-point
    link between them and the following layer 2 and layer 3 address
    assignments:

      Router 1                     Router 2
      eth0: 40:00:02:0d:00:01      eth0: 40:00:02:0d:00:02
      eth0: 192.0.2.1/24           eth0: 192.0.2.2/24


    The routers are configured to exchange routing information first
    using RIP, then OSPF, then IS-IS, and then finally BGP.

    Note, for area-based protocols, assume there is a single area
    in use throughout the network.

    For each routing protocol used, answer the following questions:

      The routing protocol would be encapsulated in (from a layering
      perspective, on top of) what lower layer protocol?

        RIP:
        OSPF:
        IS-IS:
        BGP:

      The destination address of a routing announcement would be 
      what address?

        RIP:
        OSPF:
        IS-IS:
        BGP:

      After the physical link comes up and the routers are active,
      assuming no connectivity problems and no topology changes,
      approximately how often will the same routing announcement be
      sent to a peer? 

        RIP:
        OSPF:
        IS-IS:
        BGP:
