   ___ 5                  a. You'd say this instead of saying 'Class C'

   ___ 256                b. Minimum decimal value of the IPv4 IHL field

   ___ UDP                c. The transport protocol used by BGP

   ___ 0                  d. This transport protocol has a fixed 8-byte header

   ___ 1                  e. The least specific IP address prefix

   ___ TCP                f. A loopback address in IPv6

   ___ ::1                g. IPv4 limited local broadcast address

   ___ /24                h. Maximum number of /32's that fit into a /24

   ___ 255.255.255.255    i. The initial IPv4 TTL value used when traceroute starts

   ___ /0                 j. This DNS TTL value suggests the RR not be cached



2. If a UDP DNS query receives a response with the [tc] bit set (tc=1),
   the querier generally would resend the query using TCP.  True or
   false.  (1 point)



3. Per IETF RFC 7766 DNS implementations (e.g. resolvers) are instructed
   to implement DNS over TCP.  In other words, DNS over TCP is not optional.
   Almost all implementations in fact adhere to this specification.  When
   a DNS resolver (stub, full/caching or otherwise) issues an initial query
   for a name it wants or is asked to resolve, does the query process start
   with UDP, TCP or does it vary?  Conduct your research and summarize your
   results below.  Please cite any references.  (3 points)





















4. A full resolver has the following information about a name cached:

      name: www.example.org
     class: IN
      type: A
       TTL: 295
      data: 192.0.2.1

   If after exactly three minutes a stub resolver asks the following
   question of that full resolver:

      name: www.example.org
     class: IN
      type: A

   What answer/response would you expect the full resolver to provide?
   Assume no particular limiting security policies are in place.  Select
   one answer.  (2 points)

   ___ a. NXDOMAIN (answer not available)

   ___ b. data: 192.0.2.1, TTL: 295

   ___ c. data: 192.0.2.1, TTL: 115

   ___ d. referral to example.org NS RRset



5. Which section(s) of a DNS message will always be present in both
   queries and answers?  Select one answer.  (2 points)

   ___ a. Header

   ___ b. Header, Question

   ___ c. Header, Question, Answer

   ___ d. Header, Question, Answer, Authority

   ___ e. Header, Question, Answer, Authority, Additional



6. Imagine a caching full resolver that does not currently have any
   cached information.  Further imagine that it receives a query from
   a stub resolver (rd=1) for:

     www.example.org. IN A

   What would you expect the caching full resolver to do?  Assume no
   particular limiting security policies are in place.  Select one.
   (2 points)

   ___ a. Return a referral for the root zone NS RRset to the stub

   ___ b. Return a referral for the org. zone NS RRset to the stub

   ___ c. Return a NOTIMP response to the stub

   ___ d. Ask the root server for the A type IN class data of www.example.org.



7. Which statement is false?  Select one.  (1 point)

   ___ a. All else being equal and valid, a router will select a matching
          /25 prefix over a matching /24 prefix

   ___ b. A BGP router can send an announcement and withdrawal in one update

   ___ c. The TCP MD5 authentication mechanism encrypts route data in transit

   ___ d. The first 128 bits of all BGP messages are effectively unused



8. Discuss ways to harden the resiliency of the DNS to packet flooding
   (i.e. amplification and reflection) attacks.  Discuss knobs, features
   or mechanisms in the protocol that allow you to proactively or reactively
   mitigate such attacks.  (3 points)










9. If a TCP sender transmits a segment with 50 bytes of payload data and
   a sequence number of 4926593, what is the maximum acknowledgment number
   the receiver can return after receiving that segment?  Assume no later
   segments have been sent.  (1 point)



10. Which best describes what a host should return when receiving a TCP
    SYN segment on a closed (no listening service) port?  (1 point)

    ___ a. ICMP port unreachable

    ___ b. TCP FIN

    ___ c. TCP RST, ACK

    ___ d. TCP SYN, RST, FIN, ACK



11. Fill in the blanks with the most appropriate word, phrase, value
    or acronym.  (1 point each, partial credit given)


    The __________________ resolver is a class of DNS resolvers most


    often found on end clients, while recursive caching servers are


    deployed in networks to be shared by a group of users.  DNS servers


    listen on port number ______________ by default.  The uppermost


    hierarchy of the DNS name space is called the _________________


    zone.  Many DNS server operators, particularly in the upper hierarchy


    of the name space employ a technology called _________________ which


    can help improve reliability and availability by replicating DNS


    service in a geographically diverse manner with minimal special


    hardware or protocol mechanisms.  This deployment approach has


    proved especially useful when open resolvers are being used to


    launch ______________________ and reflection DDoS attacks against


    other DNS servers.



12. Shown is the layout of an unlabeled DNS header.  Each field is
    marked with a letter.  Fill in the lettered list below with the
    associated field name or abbreviation.  (1 point each, partial

    has a portion of their address space, an important /24 slice,
    announced by an unauthorized network halfway around the world.
    Discuss what happens, how this will likely be discovered, how
    it might be re-actively addressed and proactively mitigated in
    the future. (5 points, partial credit given)

21. If an IPv4 receiver calculates a different value for the checksum
    field than what it received, what should the receiver do? (1 point)

    ___ a. Signal an error to the user application it was going to

    ___ b. Forward the datagram to the default router

    ___ c. Silently discard the datagram

    how it proved useful. (2 points)










24. Which fields of an IPv4 datagram will (or certainly should) always
    change (be updated) as the datagram passes through each IP router on
    the path to a destination?  (2 points, partial credit given)






25. In essay form, explain how the Internet works.  Focus on the core
    protocols and systems that enable the movement of communications,
    not the applications used directly by end users.  Obviously you
    might be able to write a book, but please don't.  I suggest you
    outline the main protocols and subsystems and talk about how they
    are used and why.  You don't need to get into the packet formats
    or regurgitate the standards.  This is to see if you can convey a
    sense of understanding about networking and how networks work.  Do
    use real world examples!  Do use your own words.  Plagiarism is an
    automatic zero and you can expect to be subject to an academic
    integrity report being filed against you if you violate the school's
    academic integrity policy.  (10 points total, partial credit given)





Optional Bonus Question #1 (1 point)

How many routers, at most, will forward an IPv4 datagram with a
destination address of 255.255.255.255 and an IPv4 TTL of 33.



Optional Bonus Question #2 (2 points)

Assume a host with address 192.0.2.1 is configured with a subnet
mask of 255.255.255.128 and the default router for that network
has the address 192.0.2.56 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0.  That
is, the end host has a misconfigured network mask for the network.
Assuming the router and connectivity to other networks is fine,
will the end host at 192.0.2.1 be able to talk to 140.192.1.6?
What about when 192.0.2.1 tries to talk to a host at 192.0.2.250,
will that work?  Answer both correctly for full credit (e.g. no/no,
no/yes, yes/no, yes/yes).  Feel free to elaborate if you must.




Optional Bonus Question #3 (2 points)

People often post packet dumps on line for troubleshooting assistance.
Here is an example of someone trying to hide a destination IP address.
Recover the original destination address in dotted decimal notation.

  09:39:07.148532 65.197.243.120.2557 > mercury.80: S [tcp sum ok]
         263101219:263101219(0) win 8192 <mss 1380> (DF) (ttl 106,
         id 39171, len 44)
  0x0000         4500 002c 9903 4000 6a06 b6eb 41c5 f378
  0x0010         839c 0803 09fd 0050 0fae 9b23 0000 0000
  0x0020         6002 2000 027b 0000 0204 0564 0000

  Destination address = __________________________________
