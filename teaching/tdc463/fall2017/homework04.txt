Plain text (.txt) is vastly preferred over Microsoft Word documents,
PDF, RTF or other formats.  I should be able to deal with most anything
that is in common use.

Homework:

Q1. Imagine from within DePaul's network, you ran a traceroute from a
    source host to 192.35.225.7 and this is the complete output of that
    attempt:

      $ traceroute -n ns1.dns.ucla.edu
      traceroute to 192.35.225.7, 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
       1  140.192.218.129  0.469 ms  0.531 ms  0.582 ms
       2  140.192.9.78  0.738 ms  0.783 ms  0.835 ms
       3  140.192.9.148  11.705 ms  11.716 ms  11.709 ms
       4  140.192.9.154  12.161 ms  12.162 ms  12.152 ms
       5  64.57.28.205  12.139 ms  12.127 ms  12.114 ms
       6  64.57.28.36  34.892 ms  48.195 ms  48.130 ms
       7  64.57.28.57  35.826 ms  35.896 ms  35.905 ms
       8  * * *
       9  137.164.26.133  67.003 ms  66.842 ms  66.725 ms
      10  137.164.27.6  59.239 ms  59.312 ms  59.382 ms
      11  169.232.4.100  58.931 ms  58.729 ms  58.623 ms
      12  169.232.8.7  58.943 ms  58.904 ms  58.760 ms
      13  192.35.225.7  59.062 ms  58.990 ms  58.888 ms

   Answer the following questions:

     a. Was this trace successful?  If so, how many hops to the destination?



     b. How many trace probe packets are sent?  How many responses to each
        trace probe packet are received?



     c. What would be the IPv4 TTL of any and all datagrams sent by the
        tracing station associated with the line marked as "8  * * *".



     d. What is the IP address of default router for the host performing
        the trace?



Q2. Imagine a situation where a host on the DePaul University network
    has both an IPv4 and IPv6 address assigned.  Both IPv4 and IPv6
    connectivity throughout DePaul is available and there are multiple
    exits out of DePaul, all of which support both IPv4 and IPv6.  Now
    imagine a high-speed cable modem home user in Japan who has both IPv4
    and IPv6 connectivity.  Other than the obvious difference in IP addresses,
    would an IPv4-based traceroute path be congruent to an IPv6-based
    traceroute path between the two hosts in both directions?  Explain your
    answer.



Q3. Assume the following is a complete router table for a given router:

      prefix             cost          interface   next-hop
      -----------------  ------------  ----------  -------------------
      140.192.0.0/15     100           eth0:0      connected
      140.192.0.0/24     200           eth0:1      connected
      140.192.2.1/32     100           eth0:2      connected
      140.192.128.0/18    50           eth0:3      connected
      140.192.130.0/28   150           eth0:4      connected
      0.0.0.0/0          500           eth0:4      140.192.130.2

      Answer the following questions regarding packets being relayed by
      this router.

      a. A packet destined for 140.192.0.254 will be forwarded out

         interface _____________.


      b. A packet destined for 140.192.201.1 will be forwarded out

         interface _____________.


      c. Assume there is no source-address spoofing occurring.  Should
         you be able to tell which interface a packet with IP source of
         129.105.26.1 came in on?  If so, which interface?



Q4. Some have interpreted or reinterpreted the e2e argument to suggest
    the network ought to be "stupid".  That is, data packets are king,
    and they control the flow of information, telling the network how
    to handle them and where they are to go.  Often this idea is used
    as an idea that distinguishes the traditional circuit-switched
    telephony network architecture with the packet-switched Internet
    architecture.  Does the e2e argument lead to a stupid network?
    Would you consider the Internet a stupid network?  Why or why not?



Q5. Research the 192.0.2.0/24 prefix.  What is special about it?  How
    is it used?  Cite your reference(s) material.  Now perform a WHOIS
    query for this prefix (you can use arin.net for this purpose).  Then
    perform an IP address to BGP mapping lookup for this prefix (you can
    use https://asn.cymru.com/ for this purpose).  Do you find the Team
    Cymru output unusual?  Why or why not?  Can you explain why there is
    a difference between the WHOIS and Team Cymru outputs?
