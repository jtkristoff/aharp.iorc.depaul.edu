Submit to D2L <http://d2l.depaul.edu>.

Plain text (.txt) is vastly preferred over Microsoft Word documents,
PDF, RTF or other formats.  I should be able to deal with most anything
that is in common use.

Homework:

Q1.  Is the DNS Cookies specification effective in mitigating DNS-based
     amplification and reflection attacks?  If so, how?  If not, why not?
     Can you find DNS software that implements DNS Cookies?





Q2. In the IMC 2017 paper (Role of Registrars in DNSSEC Deployment), the
    blame for the lack of DNSSEC progress it is suggested is due to the
    lack of registrar support.  However, doesn't this lead to a more basic
    question, why is registrar support lacking?  After considering the
    challenges of DNSSEC deployment from this paper and other background
    material, devise an argument on why registrars are slow to promote,
    develop, and encourage DNSSEC deployment.






Q3. BGPSEC is a suite of security mechanisms that aim to provide similar
    sorts of protection to routing that DNSSEC provides to the naming
    infrastructure.  Evaluate the state of BGPSEC deployment compared to
    DNSSEC.  Do they face similar challenges?  Would you expect one or
    the other to ultimately be more successful, or more widely adopted
    than the other?  Why or why not?  Hint: RPKI is often the specific
    technology that is being deployed today for BGPSEC.





Q4. If you queried a particular resolver and issued random A queries for
    any name and always got back the same IPv4 address as an answer,
    what is the most likely explanation for this behavior?  Note: you
    can try this by aiming queries at tdc.iorc.depaul.edu.





Q5. In our discussion about DNS over TCP I attempted to convince you
    that DNS over TCP queries and answers ought to be permitted wherever
    DNS over UDP queries and answers are permitted generally.  What did
    you find most compelling about this argument?  Least compelling?
    What would make the argument stronger or weaker?
